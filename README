This started as a fork of the Aengus McMillin's personal site (aengusmcmillin.com), in order to test his bidirectional link mechanism in gatsby at Countable.

Aengus' dependency lib, gatsby-theme-brain, needs the following change for this to work.

node_modules/@aengusm/gatsby-theme-brain/src/templates/brain.js

childMdx {
    headings {
        value
        depth
    }
}
